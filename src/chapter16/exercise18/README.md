#16.18 Pattern Matching

You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of just the letters a and b, describing the pattern withing a string. For example, the string _catcatgocatgo_ matches the pattern aabab (where _cat_ is _a_ and _go_ is _b). It also matches patterns like a,ab, and b.
Write a method to dermine if value matches pattern.
