#17.12 BiNode
Consider a simple data structure called BiNode, which has pointers to two other nodes :

public class BiNode {
    public BiNode node1, node2;
    public int data;
}

... Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list.
The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, in the original data structure).
