#15.3 Dining Philosopers
_In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are setting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always pick up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads and locks implement a simulation of the dining philosophers that prevents deadlocks.
